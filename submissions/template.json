// keep in mind that when an assignment is rendered, the quesion order, the option order,
// and the question/answer values themselves may be randomized
//
// the seed for all these randomizations is the user id
// so the question order randomization can always be reproduced by using the user id as seed
// the option order is also randomized and unrandomized using user id as seed
// For formulaic, the correct answer can be calculated on the fly for marking using user id as seed

{
    // question id -> answer (value for regular, list of lists for MCQ)
    // if a question part of the assignment is not one of the keys, it was not answered
    "1234": "answer text",  // text answer
    "23415": 10.2,   // numeric answer
    "47811": 0,     // index of option chosen (MCSAQ)
    "423190": [0, 4] // indexes of options chosen (MCMAQ)
