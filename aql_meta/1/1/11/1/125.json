We can also define sequence as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers or some subset of the type \\([1,2,3,\\ldots ,k]\\).</li> </li>\\(\\mathbf{Terms}\\):Each of the numbers in the sequence is known as terms.A sequence with finite number of terms is called a finite sequence.A sequence is called a infinite sequence if it is not a finite sequence.  </li><li>\\(\\mathbf{Series}\\): let \\(a_1,a_2,a_3, \\ldots \\) be a sequence, then the sum expressed as \\(a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots \\) is called a series. A series is called finite series if it has got finite number of terms</li>  <li>\\(\\mathbf{Arithmetic}\\) \\(\\mathbf{Progression (A.P)}\\):Any sequence be an arithmetic progression if and only if it has a constant difference between every two consecutive terms.<ul><li>\\(\\mathbf{Common}\\) \\(\\mathbf{Difference}\\): The constant difference between two consecutive terms is know as common difference.
