Common ratio is constant throughout the G.P. .</li><li>The necessary information to form a G.P. are its first term \\((a)\\) and its common ratio \\((r)\\) .</li><li>\\(\\mathbf{General}\\) \\(\\mathbf{Form}\\): General form of a G.P. is $$a,ar,ar^2,ar^3,\\ldots $$</li><li>\\(\\mathbf{General}\\) \\(\\mathbf{Term}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{n^{th}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{term}\\): General term / \\(n^{th}\\) term of a G.P. is $$a_n=ar^{n-1}$$ Where, \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio</li><li>\\(\\mathbf{Sum}\\) \\(\\mathbf{of}\\) \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) \\(\\mathbf{terms}\\): Sum of first \\(n\\) terms of a G.P. is $$S_n=\\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1} or \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$</li><li>\\(\\mathbf{Geometric}\\) \\(\\mathbf{Mean(G.M.)}\\): The geometric mean (G.M.) of any two positive numbers a and b is given by $$G.M.=\\sqrt{ab}$$</li><li>To form a G.P. by inserting \\(m\\) numbers between a and b the common ratio(r) should be $$r=\\left(\\frac ba\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m+1}}$$</li></ul>"
