The Zeroth Law describes the concept of temperature.</li>    <li><b>Internal energy</b> \\(\\Delta U\\) of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the molecular constituents of the system and does not include the kinetic energy of the system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer        to the system. Heat is the energy transfer due to temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. Work is energy transfer brought about by other means.</li>    <li>        <p><div>The <b>first law of thermodynamics</b> (also called the general law of conservation of energy) states that</div>            <div>\\(\\Delta Q = \\Delta U + \\Delta W\\)</div>            <div>where \\(\\Delta Q\\) is the heat supplied to the system, \\(\\Delta W\\) is the work done by the system and \\(\\Delta U\\) is the change in internal energy of the system.
