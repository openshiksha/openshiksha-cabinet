This Common Difference may be positive, negative or zero.</li><li>a, a+d, a+2d,a+3d....  is called the general form of an AP where 'a' is the first term and 'd' is the common difference.</li><li>Any AP where there are only finite number of terms or has a last term is called as finite AP.</li><li>To know about an AP the minimum information needed are both the first term a and the common difference d.</li></ol>"
