If in this step you get a statement with no variable, then it can be concluded that the pair of linear equation has infinitely many solutions.</li><li>Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable, obtained in step 2.</li><li>Step 4 : Substitute the value of x or y, obtained in step 3 in either of the original equations.<li>For above mentioned pair of linear equations following are the three situations that can arise :</li><h4> \\(a_1\\over a_2\\) \\(\\neq\\) \\(b_1\\over b_2\\) : Consistent</h4><h4> \\(a_1\\over a_2\\) = \\(b_1\\over b_2\\) \\(\\neq\\) \\(c_1\\over c_2\\) : Inconsistent</h4><h4> \\(a_1\\over a_2\\) = \\(b_1\\over b_2\\) = \\(c_1\\over c_2\\) : Dependent and Consistent</h4>"
