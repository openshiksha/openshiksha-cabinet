  "revision": "<h1>Substitution Method</h1><ol><li>Step 1 :  Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from either equation, whichever is convenient. </li><li>Step 2 : Substitute the value of y in other equation and reduce it in one variable, i.e., x which can be solved to find out x. If in this step you get a statement with no variable, then it can be concluded that the pair of linear equation has infinitely many solutions.</li><li>Step 3 : Substitute the value of x or y, obtained in step 2 in the equation used in step 1.</li>"
