If in this step you get a statement with no variable, then it can be concluded that the pair of linear equation has infinitely many solutions.</li><li>Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable, obtained in step 2.</li><li>Step 4 : Substitute the value of x or y, obtained in step 3 in either of the original equations."
