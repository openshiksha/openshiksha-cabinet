Then x can be expressed in the form , \\(\\frac pq\\) where p and q are coprime, and the prime factorization of q is of the form \\(2^n \\times 5^m\\), where n, m are non-negative integers.</li><li>Also , if  x =\\(\\frac pq\\) be a rational number, such that the prime factorization of q is of the form \\(2^n\\times 5^m\\). Then x has a decimal expansion which terminates.</li><li>Lastly, if x =\\(\\frac pq\\) be a rational number, such that the prime factorization of q is not of the form \\(2^n\\times 5^m\\). Then, x has a decimal expansion which is non-terminating repeating (recurring).</li></ol>"
