This is called as AAA criteria of similarity.</li><li>The above AAA similarity criteria can also be stated as, If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle, then the two triangles are similar. Therefore it is also called as AA criteria of similarity.</li><li> If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to (i.e., in the same ratio of) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similar. This is called as SSS criteria of similarity.</li><li>If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two triangles are similar. This is called as SAS criteria of similarity.</li></ol>"
