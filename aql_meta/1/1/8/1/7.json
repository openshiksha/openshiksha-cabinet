That is, a + b and a - b are again integers, where a and b are any integers.</li><li>Addition is commutative for integers, i.e., a + b = b + a for all integers a and b.</li><li>Addition is associative for integers, i.e., (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all integers a, b and c.</li><li>Integer 0 is the identity under addition. That is, a + 0 = 0 + a = a for every integer a</li><li>Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd number of negative integers is negative</li><li>Integers are closed under multiplication. That is,\\( a \\times b \\)is an integer for any two integers a and b.</li><li>Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is,\\( a \\times b = b \\times a\\) for any integers a and b.</li><li>The integer 1 is the identity under multiplication, i.e.,\\( 1 \\times a = a \\times 1 = a\\) for any integer a.</li><li>Multiplication is associative for integers, i.e.,\\( (a \\times b) \\times c = a \\times (b \\times c)\\) for any three integers a, b and c.</li><li>When a positive integer is divided by a negative integer, the quotient obtained is a negative integer and vice-versa</li><li>Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives a positive integer as quotient.</li><li>\\(a \\div 0\\) is not defined</li><li>\\(a \\div 1 = a\\)</li></ul><h4>Fractions:</h4><ul><li>Fractions are in the form of \\( \\frac {p}{q} \\). Where p and q are integers</li><li>Fractions can be positive or negative</li><li>The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom). For example, the reciprocal of \\( \\frac {4}{5} \\) is \\( \\frac {5}{4} \\)</li></ul>"
