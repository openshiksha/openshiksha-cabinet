A cuboid has:<ul><li>6 rectangular faces</li><li>12 edges (where the adjacent faces of the cuboid meet)</li><li>8 vertices (where three edges of a cuboid intersect)</li></ul></li><li>A cuboid whose length, breadth and height are equal is called a cube.</li><li>All the faces of a cube are squares, and all its edges are equal.</li><li>The volume of a solid is the measure of the space occupied by it. The standard unit for measuring volume is cubic centimetre or cu cm or \\(cm^3\\)</li><li>Surface area of a solid is the sum of the areas of its faces.</li><li>For measuring volumes of liquids, we normally use the unit litres or millilitres. \\(1 litre = 1000cm^3\\)</li><li>Remember that 1000mm = 100cm = 10dm = 1m</li><li>Similarly \\(1m^3 = 10^6 cm^3 = 1000 L\\)</li><li>Area of a trapezium = Half the sum of lengths of parallel sides \\(\\times\\) Perpendicular distance between them</li><li>Area of a rhombus = Half the product of its diagonals</li></ol><img src=\"_{1.png}_\">"
