  "revision": "<ol><li>In earlier classes we have come across algebraic expressions and equations</li><li>Examples of expressions are x - y,\\( x^2 + y^2, (x-y)^2, x^3 + y^3 + 3xy\\),etc</li><li>Now,when we add an equality sign(=) to this and another expression to the right hand side of the equality sign then ,it will be called as an equation.E.g.\\( (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\).</li><li>In the above example there are two two expressions linked by an equality sign.Thus,forming an equation.</li><li>The right hand side of equation is called R.H.S or Right hand side.The left hand side of the equation  is called L.H.S or Left Hand Side.</li><li>An equation can have many variables and those variables can be raised to  any power</li><li>In this chapter we will be dealing with only one variable and raised to the highest power  one .such equations having highest power as 1 are called linear equations.</li><li>In an equation the values of the expressions on the LHS and RHS are equal.This happens to be true only for certain values of the variable.These values of the variables are called solutions pf the equations</li><li>We assume the two sides to be balanced .We perform the same mathematical operations so that the balance is not disturbed.This way we obtain the solutions of the equations.</li><li>When there are variables on both the sides of equations,then take all the variables to one side and the constants to the other side.Further evaluate the expressions on the L.H.S and on the R.H.S independently.Simplify the variable side to a single variable by performing same operations on both the sides.</li><li>There are equations reducible to linear  form.e.g \\(\\frac{x+1}{2x+3} = \\frac 38\\) can be written as 3(x+1) = 8(2x+3)</li></ol>"
