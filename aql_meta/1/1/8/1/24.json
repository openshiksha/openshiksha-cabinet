For e.g. - 20,30,40,50,110 are all divisible by 10. </div> </li> <li> <div>Divisibility test of 5 - If the ones digit of a number is 5 or 0, that number is divisible by 5. For  e.g. - 25, 30,65,1225 are all divisible by 5. </div></li><li> <div>  Divisibility test of 2 - If the ones digit of a number is 2,4,6,8 or 0, that number is divisible by 2. For e.g. - 22, 44, 86, 78 are all divisible by 2. </div></li><li><div> Divisibility test of 9- If the sum of the digits of a number is a direct multiple of the number 9, that number is divisible by 9. For e.g. - 9963 - 9+9+6+3 = 27, which is a direct multiple of the number 9. Hence 9963 is divisible by 9. Similarly, 9643- 9+6+4+3 = 22, not a multiple of 9.Hence 9643 is NOT divisible by 9.</div></li><li><div> Divisibility test of 3- If the sum of the digits of a number is a direct multiple of the number 3, that number is divisible by 3. For e.g. - 987 - 9+8+7 = 24, which is a direct multiple of the number 3. Hence 987 is divisible by 3. Similarly, 454- 4+5+4 = 13, not a multiple of 3. Hence 454 is NOT divisible by 3.</div></li><li><div>Divisibility test of 6 - If a number is divisible by both 2 and 3 it is divisible by 6. </div></li></ol>"
