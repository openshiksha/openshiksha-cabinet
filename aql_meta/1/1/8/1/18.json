The answer is 60. We arrive to this solution where here- </div><div>No. of burgers/no. of days = k (In this case 3)</div><div>3/1= x/20=3</div><div>Therefore, x= 20*3=60.</div><div>Hence, in 20 days a man will eat 60 burgers.</div></li><li><div>In tabular form, directly proportional quantities might be represented in this form. Can you guess what the values of V and Z will be?</div><div><table class = 'table table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td>X</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>V</td><td>60</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>Z</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Yes, you were right\u2026 V is 50 and Z is 7.</div><div>With the above the given relation x/y=k (in this case k =10). Therefore,</div><div>\\( V=k \\times 5 = 50\\)</div><div>Z=\\(\\frac {70}k = 7\\)</div><div>As shown above, in tabular form we first find the proportionality constant (k) from the given values and with the help of this constant, we can then find the given missing values.</div></li></ol>"
