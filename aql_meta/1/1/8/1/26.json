In other words, a natural number obtained when a number is multiplied by itself three times are known as cube numbers. These numbers are also called perfect cubes.</li><li>Properties of Cube Numbers : <ul><li>If a number has \\(1\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(1\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(2\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(8\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(3\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(7\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(4\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(4\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(5\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(5\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(6\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(6\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(7\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(8\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(8\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(2\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(9\\) in the unit's place, then it's cube ends in \\(9\\).</li><li>Cubes of even numbers are always even and cubes of odd numbers are always odd.</li></ul></li><li>The cube of a number \\(n\\) is equal to a unique set of \\(n\\) consecutive odd natural numbers.</li><li>In the prime factorisation of a cube number, each factor appears thrice.</li><li>The cube root of a given natural number \\(m\\) is that number which when multiplied by itself three times gives \\(m\\) as the product and we denote the cube root of \\(m\\) by \\(\\sqrt[3]{m}\\).
