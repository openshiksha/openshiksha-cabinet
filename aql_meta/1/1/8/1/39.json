  "revision": "<ol><li>In earlier classes we have come across algebraic expressions and equations. Examples of expressions are \\(x - y, x^2 + y^2, (x-y)^2, x^3 + y^3 + 3xy\\),etc</li><li>Now,when we add an equality sign\\((=)\\) to this and another expression to the right hand side of the equality sign then, it will be called as an equation. For example, \\( (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\).</li><li>The right hand side of equation is called R.H.S or Right hand side. The left hand side of the equation  is called L.H.S or Left Hand Side.</li><li>An equation can have many variables and those variables can be raised to  any power. In this chapter we will be dealing with only one variable and raised to the highest power  one. Such equations having highest power as 1 are called Linear Equations.</li><li>In an equation the values of the expressions on the LHS and RHS are equal. This happens to be true only for certain values of the variable. These values of the variables are called solutions of the equations</li><li>We assume the two sides to be balanced. We perform the same mathematical operations so that the balance is not disturbed. This way we obtain the solutions of the equations.</li><li>When the Linear Equations are in the form of Fractions, i.e. the whole LHS and RHS is in the form of a fraction, then take the expression in the denominator to the numerator on the other side and multiply the expressions.</li><li>Now, take the variables to one side and the constants to the other and solve for the variable.</li><li>For example : <ul><li>\\(\\frac {2x+3}{x+1}=\\frac {4}{5}\\)</li><li>\\(\\Rightarrow 5(2x+3)=4(x+1)\\)</li><li>\\(\\Rightarrow 10x+15=4x+4\\)</li><li>\\(\\Rightarrow 6x=-11\\)</li><li>\\(\\Rightarrow x=\\frac {-11}{6}\\)</li></ul></li></ol>"
