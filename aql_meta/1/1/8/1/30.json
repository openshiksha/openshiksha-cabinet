  "revision": "<ol><li> <div> A ratio can be represented as a comparison based on two quantities with respect to one another (usually based on number) in the lowest form. For Example, if there are 4 lemons and 20 tomatoes in a basket. The ratio of number of lemons to number of tomatoes is 4:20 or when represented in lowest form - 1:5. This can be done using fractions - </div><div><ul> <li>Ratio = a:b (Where a and b are the two quantities) </li><li>\\(\\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{1}{5} = 1:5\\)</li> </ul></div><li> <div> A percentage is a relation of one quantity with respect to 100 quantities of the total set of quantities given. It is the ratio of the quantity with respect to all quantities in the set (including itself) when the denominator is 100. </div></li> <li><div>Percentage of A = \\(\\frac{Number\\, of\\, items\\, of\\, A}{Total\\, number\\, of\\, items} \\times 100 \\) </div><div>In the previous example, </div><div> <ul><li> Percentage of lemons = \\(\\frac{4}{(20+4)} \\times 100 = 16.67 \\)% </li><li>Percentage of tomatoes = \\(\\frac{20}{(20+4)} \\times 100 = 83.33\\) % </li> </uL></div><li><div> Therefore as we notice for a given set of quantities, the sum of all percentages = 100. In the previous example, Percentage of lemons + Percentage of tomatoes = 100 </div></li></ol>"
