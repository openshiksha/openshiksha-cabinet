Such a graph is called a linear graph.</li><li>Any point on the graph can be described using the co-ordinates (x,y); where 'x' tells how many units to move to the right from the origin(0,0) on x-axis and y tells how many units to move up.</li><li>Consider an example where you want to fill petrol in your vehicle. If more petrol is filled, the bill is bound to be high. This is an instance where one quatity affects the other.<ul><li>Here, the quantity of petrol  is an independent variable or a control variable.</li><li>The amount of petrol bill is the dependent variable.</li><li>The relation between dependent and independent variable can be shown through a graph.</li></ul></ol>"
