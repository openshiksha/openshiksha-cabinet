In other words, a natural number \\(m\\) is a perfect square if it is equal to the product of a number with itself. These numbers are also called perfect squares.</li><li>Properties of Square Numbers : <ul><li>If a number has \\(1\\) or \\(9\\) in the unit's place, then it's square ends in \\(1\\).</li><li>When a square number ends in \\(6\\), the number whose square it is, will have either \\(4\\) or \\(6\\) in the unit's place.</li><li>If a number has \\(2\\) or \\(8\\) in the unit's place, then it's square ends in \\(4\\).</li><li>If a number has \\(3\\) or \\(7\\) in the unit's place, then it's square ends in \\(9\\).</li><li>A number ending in \\(2, 3, 7\\) or \\(8\\) is never a perfect square.</li><li>Squares of even numbers are always even and squares of odd numbers are always odd.</li><li>\\(2n\\) non-perfect square numbers exist between the squares of the numbers \\(n\\) and \\((n+1)\\)</li><li>The sum of first \\(n\\) odd natural numbers is \\(n^2\\)</li></ul></li><li>We can express the square of any odd natural number as a sum of two consecutive integers.</li><li>For any natural number \\(m>1\\); \\(2m, (m^2-1)\\) and \\((m^2+1)\\) is a pythagorean triplet.</li><li>The square root of a given natural number \\(n\\) is that number which when multiplied by itself gives \\(n\\) as the product and we denote the square root of \\(n\\) by \\(\\sqrt{n}\\). Thus, \\(\\sqrt{n}=m \\Rightarrow n=m^2\\). Square root is the inverse operation of square. </li><li>In order to find the square root of a perfect square, resolve it into prime factors; make pairs of similar factors and take the product of prime factors, choosing one out of every pair.</li></ol>"
