(Assume that each person has equal contribution) The answer is 8. We arrive to this solution where here-</div><div>No. of people \\(\\times\\) total time taken = k (In this case 480)</div><div>1 hour = 60 min</div><div>\\( 32 \\times 15 = x \\times 60\\)</div><div>Therefore, x \\(= \\frac {32 \\times 15}{60} = 8.\\)</div><div>Hence, it takes 8 people to draft a report in 1 hour.</div></li><li><div>In tabular form, inversely proportional quantities might be represented in this form. Can you guess what the values of Z will be? </div> <div><table class = 'table table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td>X</td><td>20</td><td>Z</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Here, Z is 15.</div><div>With the above the given relation xy=k (in this case k = 60).Therefore,</div><div>\\(Z \\times 4 = 60\\)</div><div>Z \\(= \\frac {60}4 = 15\\)</div><div>As shown above, in tabular form we first find the proportionality constant (k) from the given values and with the help of this constant, we can then find the given missing values.</div></li></ol>"
