Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite numbers. Number 1 is neither prime nor composite.</li><li>The number 2 is the smallest prime number and is even. Every prime number other than 2 is odd.</li><li>Two numbers with only 1 as a common factor are called co-prime numbers.</li><li>If a number is divisible by another number then it is divisible by each of the factors of that number.</li><li>A number divisible by two co-prime numbers is divisible by their product also.</li></ul><h4>Ratios and Percentages:</h4><ul><li>Ratios are used to compare two or more quantities. For instance, while comparing the heights of two people with heights 140cm and 160cm, we can write the ratio of their heights as 140:160 or 7:8</li><li>If the simplified fractions are equal, we say the ratios are equivalent. For instance, 1:2 and 50:100 are equivalent ratios.</li><li>Two equivalent ratios are said to be in proportion. For example, the ratios 3:4 and 6:8 are equivalent. Therefore 3,4,6 and 8 are in proportion.</li><li>Quantities can also be compared using percentages. Percentages are numerators of fractions with denominator of 100. For instance, 67% means 67 out of 100.</li><li>Fractions can be converted to percentages by multiplying the numerator by a 100. For example. Percentage for of \\( \\frac 14 = \\frac 14 \\times 100 = 25\\%%\\)</li><li>Similarly percentages can be converted to fractions by dividing the amount by 100 and then simplifying. For example, 76\\(\\%% = \\frac {76}{100} = \\frac {19}{25}\\)</li><li>Decimals can also be converted to percentages. For instance, 0.43 = 43&#37; and 0.7 = 70&#37;</li></ul>"
