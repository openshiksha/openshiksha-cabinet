That is, a + b and a - b are again integers, where a and b are any integers.</li><li>Addition is commutative for integers, i.e., a + b = b + a for all integers a and b.</li><li>Addition is associative for integers, i.e., (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all integers a, b and c.</li><li>Integer 0 is the identity under addition. That is, a + 0 = 0 + a = a for every integer a</li><li>Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd number of negative integers is negative</li><li>Integers are closed under multiplication. That is,\\( a \\times b \\)is an integer for any two integers a and b.</li><li>Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is,\\( a \\times b = b \\times a\\) for any integers a and b.</li><li>The integer 1 is the identity under multiplication, i.e.,\\( 1 \\times a = a \\times 1 = a\\) for any integer a.</li><li>Multiplication is associative for integers, i.e.,\\( (a \\times b) \\times c = a \\times (b \\times c)\\) for any three integers a, b and c.</li><li>When a positive integer is divided by a negative integer, the quotient obtained is a negative integer and vice-versa</li><li>Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives a positive integer as quotient.</li><li>\\(a \\div 0\\) is not defined</li><li>\\(a \\div 1 = a\\)</li></ul><h4>Fractions:</h4><ul><li>Fractions are in the form of \\( \\frac {p}{q} \\). Where p and q are integers</li><li>Fractions can be positive or negative</li><li>The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom). For example, the reciprocal of \\( \\frac {4}{5} \\) is \\( \\frac {5}{4} \\)</li></ul><h4>Decimals:</h4><ul><li>Fractions can be expressed as decimals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by a number that makes the numerator either 10, 100 or 1000. For example,\\( \\frac 45 \\) can be multiplied by \\( \\frac 22 \\) to make it \\( \\frac {4 \\times 2}{5 \\times 2} = \\frac {8}{10} \\)= 0.8.</li><li>Similarly, \\( \\frac 54\\) can be multiplied by\\( \\frac {25}{25}\\) to make it\\( \\frac { 5 \\times 25 }{ 4 \\times 25} = \\frac {125}{100} = 1.25\\)</li><li>While multiplying two decimal numbers, first multiply them as whole numbers. Count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in both the decimal numbers. Add the number of digits counted. Put the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place. The count should be the sum obtained earlier. For example,\\( 0.4 \\times 0.7 = 0.28\\)</li><li>To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1. For example \\(0.545 \\times 10 = 5.45, 0.726 \\times 100 = 72.6, 0.24 \\times 1000 = 240\\)</li><li>While dividing decimal numbers:<ul><li>To divide a decimal number by a whole number, first divide them as whole numbers. Then place the decimal point (maintain the same number of digits behind the point). For example,\\( 8.4 \\div 4 = 2.1.\\) Similarly \\(6.25 \\div 25 =/li><li>To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. For example, \\(53.2 \\div 10 = 5.32, 53.2 \\div 100 = 0 .532, 53.2 \\div 1000 = 0/li><li>While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by equal number of places in both. Then divide. For example, \\(2.4 \\div 0.2 = 24 \\div 2 = 12\\). Similarly, \\(2.28 \\div 0.2 = 22.8 \\div 2 = 11.4\\)</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Factorisation:</h4><ul><li>A factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number</li><li>Every number is a factor of itself. 1 is a factor of every number.</li><li>Every factor of a number is less than or equal to the given number.</li><li>Every number is a multiple of each of its factors.</li><li>Every multiple of a given number is greater than or equal to that number.</li><li>Every number is a multiple of itself.</li><li>The Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two or more given numbers is the highest of their common factors.</li><li>The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more given numbers is the lowest of their common multiples.</li></ul><h4>Prime Numbers:</h4><ul><li>The number other than 1, with only factors namely 1 and the number itself, is a prime number. Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite numbers. Number 1 is neither prime nor composite.</li><li>The number 2 is the smallest prime number and is even. Every prime number other than 2 is odd.</li><li>Two numbers with only 1 as a common factor are called co-prime numbers.</li><li>If a number is divisible by another number then it is divisible by each of the factors of that number.</li><li>A number divisible by two co-prime numbers is divisible by their product also.</li></ul><h4>Divisibility:</h4><ul><li>Divisibility by 2,5 and 10 can be seen by just the last digit.</li><li>Divisibility by 3 and 9 is checked by finding the sum of all digits.</li><li>Divisibility by 4 and 8 is checked by the last 2 and 3 digits respectively.</li><li>Divisibility of 11 is checked by comparing the sum of digits at odd and even places.</li><li>If two numbers are divisible by a number then their sum and difference are also divisible by that number.</li></ul><h4>Rational Numbers:</h4><ul><li>A number that can be expressed in the form \\( \\frac pq\\), where p and q are integers and \\( q \\neq 0\\), is called a rational number. The numbers \\( \\frac 23, -3, \\frac {-8}7,\\) 105 etc. are rational numbers.</li><li>All integers and fractions are rational numbers.</li><li>If the numerator and denominator of a rational number are multiplied or divided by a non-zero integer, we get a rational number which is said to be equivalent to the given rational number. For example\\( \\frac 37 = \\frac {(3 \\times 2)}{(7 \\times 2)} = \\frac 6{14}\\). Therefore \\( \\frac 6{14} \\) is the equivalent form of \\( \\frac 37 \\).</li><li>Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. When the numerator and denominator, both, are positive integers, it is a positive rational number. When either the numerator or the denominator is a negative integer, it is a negative rational number. For example,\\( \\frac 45\\) is a positive rational number whereas \\( \\frac {-5}2 \\) is a negative rational number.</li><li>The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.</li><li>A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1. For example - \\( \\frac {-1}4\\) and \\( \\frac 25 \\) are in standard form but \\( \\frac 4{10}\\) is not.</li><li>There are infinite number of rational numbers between two rational numbers.</li><li><div>Two rational numbers with the same denominator can be added by adding their numerators, keeping the denominator same. Two rational numbers with different denominators are added by first taking the LCM of the two denominators and then converting both the rational numbers to their equivalent forms having the LCM as the denominator. For example,</div><div>\\( \\frac 13 + \\frac 43 = \\frac 53 \\)[Same Denominator]</div><div>\\( \\frac 13 + \\frac 45\\)</div><div>LCM of 3 and 5 is 15</div><div>Therefore, \\( \\frac 13 + \\frac 45 = \\frac {1 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5} + \\frac {4 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac {5 + 12}{15} = \\frac {17}{15}\\)</div></li><li><div>While subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational number to be subtracted to the other rational number. For example,</div><div>\\( \\frac 45 â€“ \\frac 38 = \\frac 45 \\) + (additive inverse of \\( \\frac 38\\)) = \\(\\frac 45 + \\frac{-3}8 = \\frac {32 - 15}{40} = \\frac {17}{40}\\)</div></li><li><div>To multiply two rational numbers, we multiply their numerators and denominators separately, and write the product as product of numerators \\(\\div\\) product of denominators. For example,</div><div>\\( \\frac 23 \\times \\frac 45 = \\frac {2 \\times 4}{3 \\times 5} = \\frac 8{15}\\)</div></li><li><div>To divide one rational number by the other non-zero rational number, we multiply the rational number by the reciprocal of the other. For example,</div><div>\\( \\frac 23 \\div \\frac 45 = \\frac 23 \\times\\) (reciprocal of \\(\\frac 45\\)) = \\(\\frac 23 \\times \\frac 54 = \\frac {10}{12} = \\frac 56\\)</div></li></ul><h4>Ratios and Percentages:</h4><ul><li>Ratios are used to compare two or more quantities. For instance, while comparing the heights of two people with heights 140cm and 160cm, we can write the ratio of their heights as 140:160 or 7:8</li><li>If the simplified fractions are equal, we say the ratios are equivalent. For instance, 1:2 and 50:100 are equivalent ratios.</li><li>Two equivalent ratios are said to be in proportion. For example, the ratios 3:4 and 6:8 are equivalent. Therefore 3,4,6 and 8 are in proportion.</li><li>Quantities can also be compared using percentages. Percentages are numerators of fractions with denominator of 100. For instance, 67% means 67 out of 100.</li><li>Fractions can be converted to percentages by multiplying the numerator by a 100. For example. Percentage for of \\( \\frac 14 = \\frac 14 \\times 100 = 25\\%%\\)</li><li>Similarly percentages can be converted to fractions by dividing the amount by 100 and then simplifying. For example, 76\\(\\%% = \\frac {76}{100} = \\frac {19}{25}\\)</li><li>Decimals can also be converted to percentages. For instance, 0.43 = 43&#37; and 0.7 = 70&#37;</li></ul>"
