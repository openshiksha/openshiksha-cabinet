  "revision": "<ol><li><div>When we say the number is 123, what do we mean? In the decimal system (Also known as the hindu-arabic) The number 'one hundred and twenty three'  is termed as 123 which means - \\((100 \\times 1) + (10 \\times 2) + 3\\). </div><div> Let us take another example to be completely clear - 759. 759 is written as \\((100 \\times 7) + (10 \\times 5) + 9\\). </div> </li> <li> <div> In the above given examples, there are two forms in which we represent the number - </div><ul><li>Usual form - \\(759\\) </li><li> Generalized form - \\((100 \\times 7) + (10 \\times 5) + 9\\)</li> </ul><div> Taking another example, for the number 'two hundred and fifty eight' - </div> <div> The usual form of the number is - \\(258\\) </div> <div>The generalized form is - \\((100 \\times 2) + (10 \\times 5) + 8 \\)</div>  </li><li> <div> In finding the numerical value of a letter in place of a digit, We follow two major rules - </div><div> <ul><li>  Each letter in the question must stand for only one digit. Each digit must be represented by only one letter. </li><li>  The first digit of any number cannot be zero. Eg. - 'seventy-nine' is written as 79 NOT 079 or 00079.</li></ul></div><div class='container'> <img src='_{20.png}_'/></div> <div>In the example above - We need to find one letter A. Here we can see 8 + A =0 </div><div> Here, as 0 is the ones digit of the answer then the only value that fits is 2. (8+2=10) </div> <div>Therefore, A = 2. </div></li></ol>"
