In general, any expression containing one or more terms with non-zero coefficients is called a polynomial.</li><li>Like terms are formed from the same variables and the powers of these variables are the same, too (e.g. \\(4x^2\\) and \\(6x^2\\)). Coefficients of like terms need not be the same.</li><li>While adding (or subtracting) polynomials, first look for like terms and add (or subtract) them; then handle the unlike terms.</li><li>There are a number of situations in which we need to multiply algebraic expressions: for example, in finding area of a rectangle, the sides of which are given as expressions.</li><li>A monomial multiplied by a monomial always gives a monomial.</li><li>While multiplying a polynomial by a monomial, we multiply every term in the polynomial by the monomial.</li><li>In carrying out the multiplication of a polynomial by a binomial (or trinomial), we multiply term by term. i.e. every term of the polynomial is multiplied by every term of the binomial (or trinomial).
