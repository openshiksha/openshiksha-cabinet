    "text": "A carnot cycle considers a reversible engine that operates between only two temperatures.<br><br>The process used must be a reversible <b>adiabatic process</b> which involves no heat flow from any reservoir. If another process is employed instead (say an isochoric process) to take the system from one temperature to another, we would need a series of reservoirs in the temperature range \\(T_1\\) to \\(T_2\\) to ensure that at each stage the process is quasi-static but this violates our previous goal of operating only between two temperatures. Since the pressure and volume are increasing, it must be <b>adiabatic compression</b>"
