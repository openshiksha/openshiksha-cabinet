    "text": "<div>Let the number be represented by abcd (for instance if the number was 3456 then a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 and d = 6)</div><div>Given</div><div>d = 2a</div><div>b = c-a</div><div>d = c-1</div><div>a &lt; 6 and is odd so a = 1,3,5 but d=2a and d can't be equal to 10, therefore a = 1,3</div><div>Let's assume a = 1</div><div>Then d = 2a = 2, c = d+1 = 3 and b = c-a = 2</div><div>Thus the number would be 1232. But it is given that no two digits are the same, therefore a = 3.</div><div>Then d = 2a = 6, c = d+1 = 7 and b = c-a = 4</div><div>Thus the number is 3746</div>"
