    "text": "<div>Since Rs. _{{100*j}}_ is the profit on bat one.</div><div> Hence, profit percentage = (_{{100*j}}_/_{{1000*j}}_) x 100 = 10%</div><div> loss percentage = profit percentage - 5 = 10-5 = 5%</div><div> So, Loss = (loss percentage x cost price) /100 = (5 x _{{1000*j}}_)/100 = Rs. _{{50*j}}_</div><div> \\( \\Rightarrow \\) Therefore, Selling price of bat 2 = Original price - loss = _{{1000*j}}_ - _{{50*j}}_ = Rs. _{{950*j}}_ </div>"
