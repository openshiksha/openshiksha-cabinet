Take the number as the divisor and the number under the left-most bar as the dividend.

In this case we see that \\(105 \\times 5 = 525\\). Get the remainder.</li><li>The remainder is \\(75\\). This shows that \\(55^2\\lt3100\\)</li></ol><div>The next perfect square number is \\(56^2=3136\\)</div><div>Hence, The number to be added is \\(56^2-3100=3136-3100=36\\)</div>",
