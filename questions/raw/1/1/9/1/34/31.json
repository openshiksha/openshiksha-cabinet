However, there is only one way to select it such that you get a zero digit.<br><br>Similarly units digit ( _ _ * ) has 10 possibilities - (<b>0</b>,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). However, there is only one way to select it such that you get a zero digit.<br><br>Therefore, in total, you have 9 ways of selecting the hundreds digit, one way of selecting the tens digit and one way of selecting the units digit. Thus, total number of three digit numbers with <b>two zero digits</b> in them is \\(9 * 1 * 1 = 9\\)<br><br>\\(P(E) = \\frac{Number\\;of\\;trials\\;in\\;which\\;E\\;has\\;happened}{Total\\;number\\;of\\;trials}\\)<br><br>Therefore, the probability that the number has <b>two zero digits</b> is:<br>\\(P(E) = \\frac{9}{900} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01\\)"
